# SOLID Principles

SOLID is the mnemonic acronym that represents 5 design principles that aim to make software designs more understandable, flexible and sustainable.

## Single Reponsibility

Each entity (module, class, or function) should have a single responsibility over a part of a feature in a system, and this responsibility should be encapsulated. In other words, each module should be responsible for a single thing or have only one reason to change.

## Open-Closed

Each entity should be closed for modification but open for extension.

## Liskov Substitution

If B is a subtype of A, then objects of type A should be exchangeable by objects of type B without affecting the desired result.

## Interface Segregation

A client should not be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

## Dependency Inversion

High-level modules should not import anything from low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
